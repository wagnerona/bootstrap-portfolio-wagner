# Week 3 challenge "Bootstrap portfolio"

## Welcome to my responsive portfolio

I am currently enrolled in a front-end web development bootcamp, and as part of the program, I am creating this portfolio to showcase my skills and projects.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to create responsive, mobile-friendly layouts using Bootstrap. I want to ensure that my portfolio looks great and is easy to use on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

## Acceptance criteria

- A navigation bar
- A naviogation menu
- Hero Section

## Usage

## Things learnt

- Bootstrap is pretty useful for fast mockups, however creating a custom css can take a long time

- Page responds well on medium devices, however more media querys are needed for when the screen gets smaller.

- Base strcuture is here but still needs more work on content
